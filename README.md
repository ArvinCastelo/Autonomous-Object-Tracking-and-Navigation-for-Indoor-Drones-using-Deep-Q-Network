# Autonomous Indoor Drone Navigation using Deep Q-Networks and YOLO Object Detection

This repository contains the codebase for a research project exploring autonomous indoor drone navigation through the integration of **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** and **YOLO-based object detection**. The goal is to enable a drone to learn how to locate and navigate toward specific objects within an indoor environment using reinforcement learning with real-time visual input.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project combines:

- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** via DQN for decision making
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for real-time object detection
- **Epsilon-greedy action selection** to balance exploration and exploitation
- **Online and Offline training approaches** for performance comparison

The system trains a drone agent to identify and approach target objects in a simulated environment. Performance is assessed based on accumulated rewards and loss reduction during training.
